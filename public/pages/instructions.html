        <h1>Getting Ready</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Thanks for participating in this study. We are examining skill learning. You will play a very simple video
            game for about 30 minutes.</p>

        <p>A few reminders:</p>

        <p>1) If you are using a laptop, please use a mouse instead of the laptop trackpad for this game.</p>

        <p>2) Before continuing, please make sure there are no system or browser popups that might occur for the
            duration of this experiment. Once you begin, we will need your full attention on the game. </p>
        <p style="color:red">3) If you click outside of the game and do anything else (like check your email) during the
            game you will be disqualified from participation.</p>

        <br><br>

        <h1>Game Instructions</h1>

        <p>Please read the game instructions below carefully as there will be a quiz before the game begins.</p>

        <hr>

        <p>On each play, a "Demon" will appear at the bottom of the screen, heading upward. It will pause for 3 seconds
            for you to look at before going into the tunnel.</p>

        <p>After the demon goes into the tunnel, it will re-appear on either the upper left or the upper right side of
            the screen, moving horizontally off the screen. At this point, your job is to click on the demon before it
            disappears. You have to be fast to get it! You get one point per click.</p>

        <p>There will be a 20 second rest period after every block (30 plays) of the game. If you score on 100% of the
            plays in any block of plays, you will not need to play anymore and will be allowed to end early (after you
            answer a few questions.)</p>

        <p>We need your full concentration throughout this experiment. So please try your best! Thanks for
            participating, and have fun!</p>
